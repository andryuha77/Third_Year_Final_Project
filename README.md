# Third Year Final Project
### Project idea for PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE IN IT.

For my final project, I would like to create an automatic trading program (Expert Advisor (EA)) for the FOREX (foreign exchange) market.

In my trading program, Iâ€™m planning to use a few indicators which will analyse currency graph trends and breakouts. Using these different indicators, the EA will decide what action to take: to buy or to sell the currency pair. Also, I will try to implement a few different trading strategies in one program.

After creating the EA, it will be possible to test the code on previous historical data provided by brokers and choose the best settings for the EA.

Also, research needs to be done to gain a better understanding of the Forex market and choosing the right broker firm with support of Metatrader 4 trading platform.

An Expert Advisor (EA) is an automated trading system written in MQL4 programming language and is designed for operating under Metatrader 4 trading platform. The EA can be programmed to fully trade and manage all aspects of trading.

MQL4 is a C-like language, which is one of the fastest and most functionally valuable languages in the world. Its flexibility makes it possible to thoroughly verify all parameters of Expert Advisors. This enables developers to automate almost any trading strategy. As far as its speed characteristics are concerned, MQL4 outperforms all specialized languages for trading strategies and comes second only to such high-level languages as Java and C++. This combination of wide functionality and high performance has made MQL4 the first choice of most traders.
